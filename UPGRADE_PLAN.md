# Social Credit Bot - Comprehensive Upgrade Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete upgrade plan for transforming the Social Credit Bot from a simple message analyzer into a feature-complete, highly engaging, and long-lasting interactive game. The upgrades have been implemented with a focus on persistent engagement, robust architecture, and scalable gamification mechanics.

## Section 1: Advanced Gameplay Mechanics

### A. Enhanced Sanctions (Low Social Credit Users)

#### 1. Public Re-education (Punishment)
- **Command**: `/public-confession`
- **Required Score**: < -200

  - Bot assigns task: React with üá®üá≥ emoji to next 10 messages from Good Citizens (score > 500)
  - 30-minute time limit
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Success: +15 social credit
  - No penalty for failure, just retry cooldown

#### 3. Ideological Quiz (Challenge)
- **Command**: `/loyalty-quiz`

  - Random monitored channel selection for announcements
  - LLM-generated dynamic events with JSON parsing
  - Centralized event lifecycle management
  - Enhanced event effects integration
  - Fallback mechanisms for LLM failures

### C. Enhanced Message Analysis
- **Configuration**: Updated `CONFIG.LLM.ENHANCED_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`
- **Improvements**: 
  - Better negation detection ("I don't love the party" = negative)
  - Context-aware quoting handling (don't penalize for quoting others)
  - Sarcasm detection improvements
  - Intent-focused analysis over literal content
  - Reduced false positives

## Section 3: Gamification & Long-Term Engagement

### A. Daily Directives & Weekly Goals
- **File**: `src/managers/DirectiveManager.ts`
- **Command**: `/directive` (to be implemented in command handlers)
- **Features**: 
  - LLM-generated personalized daily tasks
  - Progress tracking for various activity types:
    - Message count
    - Keyword usage 
    - Social interactions
    - Score gains
  - Weekly goals for sustained engagement
  - Automatic completion detection and rewards

### B. The Party Store (Future Implementation)
- **Configuration**: `CONFIG.PARTY_STORE`
- **Items Available**: 
  - Custom rank title (500 credits, 7 days)
  - Pardon negative entry (1000 credits)
  - Custom color role (2000 credits, 7 days)
- **Minimum Score**: 800+ to access

### C. Leaderboard Seasons (Future Implementation)
- **Configuration**: `CONFIG.GAMIFICATION`
- **Features**: 
  - Monthly seasons (30 days)
  - Top 3 users archived to Hall of Fame
  - Score soft-reset: `newScore = oldScore * 0.25`
  - `/hall-of-fame` command to view past winners

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```
Users Collection (existing):
- userId, guildId, score, totalChanges, etc.

ActiveEffects Collection (new):
- effectId, userId, guildId, effectType, expiresAt, metadata
- TTL index on expiresAt for automatic cleanup

ScoreHistory Collection (existing):
- Extended usage for investigation feature

Future Collections:
- Directives: Daily/weekly goals storage
- Seasons: Historical leaderboard data  
- PartyStore: Purchase history and active items
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexing**: All new collections have proper compound indexes
2. **Memory Management**: In-memory caches with periodic cleanup
3. **Rate Limiting**: Enhanced cooldown systems prevent spam
4. **LLM Cost Optimization**: Cheap model usage for neutral users
5. **Event Scoping**: Guild-specific events reduce server load

### Security & Moderation

1. **Content Filtering**: LLM-based moderation for propaganda broadcasts
2. **Cooldown Enforcement**: Database-backed cooldown system
3. **Score Limits**: Existing min/max score constraints maintained
4. **Investigation Privacy**: Results only visible to investigator
5. **Effect Isolation**: Guild-scoped effects prevent cross-server issues
